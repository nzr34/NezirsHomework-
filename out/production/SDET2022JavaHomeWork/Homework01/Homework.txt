3) Create a Java program and name it Variables
In your program create different type of variables to store student’s information and then print value of those variables:
name
lastName
grade
city
state
phoneNumber
b)   Change student’s city, state, phone number and grade. And print those updated values. (edited)

4) Write a Java program to add, subtract, multiply and divide 2 decimal values. Your program should say.
 “The __ of 2 numbers __ and  is equal to __”
Expected Output:
The Addition of 2 numbers 10.5 and 10.5 is equal to 21.0
The Subtraction of 2 numbers 10.5 and 10.5 is equal to 0.0
The Multiplication of 2 numbers 10.5 and 10.5 is equal to 110.25
The Division of 2 numbers 10.5 and 10.5 is equal to 1.0
Write a program to find the square of the number 3.9. You program should say “The square of the  is  “
Expected output:

The square of the 3.9 is 15.209999999999999

5) Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle with width = 5 and  height = 8. Your program should say. “The perimeter of a rectangle with width  and height __ is equal to __ and the area is __”
The perimeter of a rectangle with width 5.0 and height 8.0 is equal to 26.0 and the area is 40.0


 /* Another Example!
        // Declare and initialize variables for each primitive data type
        boolean isTrue = true;
        char letter = 'A';
        byte smallNumber = 100;
        short mediumNumber = 10000;
        int largeNumber = 10000000;
        long veryLargeNumber = 10000000000L;
        float decimalNumber = 3.14f;
        double veryPreciseNumber = 2.718281828459045;

        // Print the values of each variable
        System.out.println("Value of isTrue: " + isTrue);
        System.out.println("Value of letter: " + letter);
        System.out.println("Value of smallNumber: " + smallNumber);
        System.out.println("Value of mediumNumber: " + mediumNumber);
        System.out.println("Value of largeNumber: " + largeNumber);
        System.out.println("Value of veryLargeNumber: " + veryLargeNumber);
        System.out.println("Value of decimalNumber: " + decimalNumber);
        System.out.println("Value of veryPreciseNumber: " + veryPreciseNumber);

        Java is a programming language that allows you to create programs that run on a computer.
        A Java program is made up of one or more classes, and each class contains methods that
        specify what the class can do.

        In this program, we are creating a class called PracticeVariables that has a main method.
        The main method is a special method that is automatically executed when the program runs.
        Inside the main method, we are creating variables for each of the eight primitive data types
        in Java: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.A variable is a named
        storage location in a program that holds a value.
        In this program, we are giving each variable a value that represents the minimum or maximum
        value for its data type.
        For example, the byte variable is assigned the value -128, which is the minimum value for a byte in Java.
        After we have created and assigned values to all of the variables,
        we are using the System.out.println method to print the values of each variable to the console.
        This allows us to see the range of values that each data type can hold.
